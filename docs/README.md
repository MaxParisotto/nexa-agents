## Overview
Nexa Agents is a full-stack system designed to orchestrate AI agents, enabling them to operate as an autonomous team with minimal supervision.

## Architecture
The system consists of the following components:

1. **User Interface**
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring and controlling agent teams
- Task assignment interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time status updates using WebSocket

2. **Task Management API**
- RESTful endpoints for task creation, assignment, and status updates
- Direct integration with Rust message queue
- Load balancing across agents

3. **Rust Message Queue**
- Custom-built in Rust for high performance
- In-memory message storage (can be extended to persistent storage)
- Publish/subscribe pattern for agent communication
- Built-in load balancing logic

4. **Agent Containers**
- Individual processes or threads within the same application
- Standardized interface for receiving tasks
- Built-in monitoring and error handling

5. **Monitoring System**
- Real-time metrics dashboard
- Task completion tracking
- Agent performance analytics

6. **Database**
- Persistent storage for tasks and their status
- Historical data for analysis
- Agent performance metrics

7. **Centralized Logging**
- Unified logging system for all components
- Error tracking and reporting
- Audit trail for task assignments
