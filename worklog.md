### Initial Assessment
- Basic React setup with Redux integration exists
- Core dependencies installed: react, react-dom, react-redux, redux, redux-thunk
- Basic App component and store configuration present

### Current Tasks
1. Set up project structure for full-stack system
2. Install additional required dependencies
3. Implement core components:
   - Frontend Layer (React Dashboard)
   - Backend Infrastructure (WebSocket Server)
   - Task Management API
   - Rust Message Queue
   - Agent System
   - Data Management Layer

### Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for all components
2. Set up WebSocket server
3. Implement Redux reducers and actions
4. Create dashboard components
5. Set up containerized agent system
6. Implement database and logging system

### Progress
- [x] Initial project assessment
- [x] Project structure setup
  - Created directory structure for components, containers, services, utils, server, store, and styles
- [x] Frontend implementation started
  - Installed additional dependencies (MUI, Socket.IO, etc.)
  - Set up Redux store with reducers
  - Implemented WebSocket service
  - Created action creators for system, agents, and tasks
- [x] Backend implementation started
  - Created WebSocket server with Express
  - Implemented basic event handlers
  - Added health check endpoint
- [ ] Agent system implementation
- [ ] Data management implementation

### Completed Infrastructure Components
1. Redux Store Structure
   - Root reducer combining agents, tasks, and system states
   - Action creators for all major operations
   - Thunk middleware for async operations

2. WebSocket Integration
   - Server-side socket handlers for real-time events
   - Client-side WebSocket service
   - Event-based communication system

3. State Management
   - System state (metrics, notifications, errors)
   - Agent state (status, registration, deactivation)
   - Task state (creation, assignment, completion)

### Frontend Components Implementation
1. Dashboard Layout
   - Responsive Material-UI layout
   - Persistent navigation drawer
   - Dynamic content area

2. Dashboard Overview
   - Real-time metrics display
   - System status monitoring
   - Agent and task statistics
   - WebSocket connection status

3. Environment Configuration
   - Added environment variables for frontend and backend
   - Configured development settings
   - Set up system parameters

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Create remaining React components:
   - Agent management interface
   - Task management interface
   - System monitoring widgets
2. Implement drag-and-drop task assignment
3. Add real-time metrics collection
4. Set up containerized agent system
5. Implement database integration

### Current Development Status
- Frontend framework is set up with core components
- Real-time communication infrastructure is in place
- Basic monitoring and metrics are implemented
- Ready to begin implementing agent and task management interfaces

### Testing Needed
1. WebSocket connection and event handling
2. Redux state management
3. Real-time metrics updates
4. Component rendering and responsiveness
5. Environment configuration loading
