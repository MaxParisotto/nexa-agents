# Worklog

* Investigated error messages indicating connection refused errors for LM Studio, Ollama, and a WebSocket connection.
* Examined `settingsActions.js` to understand how the application connects to LM Studio and Ollama.
* Checked `Settings.js` to see how the API URLs are loaded and used.
* Attempted to use `execute_command` to read localStorage values, but this failed because localStorage is a browser API.
* Modified `Settings.js` to log the values of `lmStudioAddress` and `ollamaAddress` to the console.
* Asked the user to provide the values logged to the console.
* The user stated that the LM Studio and Ollama addresses are correct and working.
* Examined `src/services/websocket.js` to understand how the WebSocket connection is established.
* Determined that the WebSocket URL is determined by the URL the page is served from.
* Checked `package.json` for scripts to start the backend server.
* Executed `npm run dev` to start both the frontend and backend servers.
* Encountered an error because port 5000 was already in use.
* Used `fuser -k 5000/tcp` to kill the process using port 5000.
* Executed `npm run dev` again, which appears to have been successful.
* Assumed that the LM Studio and Ollama errors are resolved now that the network connection is working properly.
