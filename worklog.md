### Initial Assessment

- Basic React setup with Redux integration exists
- Core dependencies installed: react, react-dom, react-redux, redux, redux-thunk
- Basic App component and store configuration present

### Current Tasks

1. Set up project structure for full-stack system
2. Install additional required dependencies
3. Implement core components:
   - Frontend Layer (React Dashboard)
   - Backend Infrastructure (WebSocket Server)
   - Task Management API
   - Rust Message Queue
   - Agent System
   - Data Management Layer

### Next Steps

1. Create directory structure for all components
2. Set up WebSocket server
3. Implement Redux reducers and actions
4. Create dashboard components
5. Set up containerized agent system
6. Implement database and logging system

### Completed Infrastructure Components

1. Redux Store Structure
   - Root reducer combining agents, tasks, and system states
   - Action creators for all major operations
   - Thunk middleware for async operations

2. WebSocket Integration
   - Server-side socket handlers for real-time events
   - Client-side WebSocket service
   - Event-based communication system

3. State Management
   - System state (metrics, notifications, errors)
   - Agent state (status, registration, deactivation)
   - Task state (creation, assignment, completion)
