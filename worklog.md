### Issue Investigation

- Investigating 404 errors for API endpoints:
  - HEAD <http://localhost:3001/api/health> net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
  - GET <http://localhost:3001/api/settings> 404 (Not Found)
  - GET <http://localhost:3001/api/tools> 404 (Not Found)
- Checked client API code in `client/src/services/api.js`
- Checked server implementation in `server/src/index.js`
- Found that routes are defined in `server/src/routes/` but not properly imported in the main server file
- The routes/index.js file has routes defined but they're not being mounted in the main Express app
- Found a separate API implementation in `server/src/api/index.js` that has the required endpoints defined:
  - `/api/health` endpoint is defined
  - `/api/settings` endpoint is mounted
  - But this API implementation doesn't seem to be used in the main server file
- Found a tools endpoint is missing in both implementations
- The server has two separate implementations:
  1. `server/src/index.js` - The main server file that's currently running
  2. `server/src/api/index.js` - A more complete API implementation with the required endpoints

### Root Cause

The issue is that the server is not properly mounting the API routes. The main server file (`server/src/index.js`) doesn't import and use the routes defined in `server/src/routes/index.js`. Additionally, there's a more complete API implementation in `server/src/api/index.js` that has the required endpoints, but it's not being used.

### Solution

There are two possible solutions:

1. **Option 1: Use the existing API implementation**
   - Update the main server file to use the API implementation in `server/src/api/index.js`
   - This is the more complete solution as it already has the required endpoints

2. **Option 2: Add the missing endpoints to the current implementation**
   - Add the missing endpoints to the main server file
   - Import and mount the routes from `server/src/routes/index.js`
   - Add a `/api/health` endpoint
   - Add a `/api/tools` endpoint

I'll implement Option 1 as it's the more complete solution and requires fewer changes.

### Implementation

1. **Created a tools route file**
   - Created `server/src/api/routes/tools.js` with endpoints for:
     - GET `/api/tools` - Get all tools
     - POST `/api/tools` - Create a new tool
     - PUT `/api/tools/:id` - Update a tool
     - DELETE `/api/tools/:id` - Delete a tool

2. **Updated the API implementation**
   - Modified `server/src/api/index.js` to import and mount the tools route

3. **Updated the main server file**
   - Simplified `server/src/index.js` to use the API implementation from `server/src/api/index.js`
   - This ensures all required endpoints are available:
     - `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
     - `/api/settings` - Settings endpoint
     - `/api/tools` - Tools endpoint

4. **Fixed syntax errors in server and client files**
   - Fixed an invalid export syntax in `server/src/services/metricsService.js`
   - Changed `module.exports = { metricsService as globalMetricsService };` to
     `module.exports = metricsService; module.exports.globalMetricsService = metricsService;`
   - Updated `server/src/api/routes/metrics.js` to correctly import and use the metrics functions
   - Added proper destructuring of the metrics functions from the service
   - Fixed ES module syntax in `server/src/utils/logger.js` that was causing errors
   - Removed ES module imports (`fileURLToPath` and `import.meta.url`) since the project uses CommonJS
   - Added missing `createLogger` function to `server/src/utils/logger.js` that was being imported by other modules
   - Fixed TypeError in `client/src/components/settings/LlmProviderSettings.jsx` by adding proper array type checking
   - Added `Array.isArray()` checks before accessing `length` property on potentially undefined arrays

### Testing

The changes should fix the 404 errors for:

- HEAD <http://localhost:3001/api/health>
- GET <http://localhost:3001/api/settings>
- GET <http://localhost:3001/api/tools>

The server now uses a more complete API implementation that includes all the required endpoints.

### Issue Investigation: MUI LinearProgress Error and React Warning

- Investigating two React errors:
  1. `MUI: You need to provide a value prop when using the determinate or buffer variant of LinearProgress`
  2. `Warning: Cannot update a component ('Settings') while rendering a different component ('LlmProviderSettings')`
- Checked the code in `client/src/components/features/Tasks.jsx` and found a LinearProgress component without a variant prop
- Checked the code in `client/src/components/settings/LlmProviderSettings.jsx` and found a state update during render

#### Root Cause

1. **LinearProgress Error**: In `Tasks.jsx`, there was a LinearProgress component without a variant prop. When no variant is specified, it defaults to "indeterminate", but somewhere in the component tree, it was being set to "determinate" or "buffer" without a corresponding value prop.

2. **React Warning**: In `LlmProviderSettings.jsx`, there was a call to `onUpdateSettings` during the render phase, which is not allowed in React. This was happening in a conditional check at the beginning of the component.

#### Solution

1. **LinearProgress Fix**: Added an explicit `variant="indeterminate"` prop to the LinearProgress component in `Tasks.jsx` to ensure it doesn't try to use "determinate" or "buffer" without a value prop.

2. **React Warning Fix**: Refactored the `LlmProviderSettings.jsx` component to:
   - Move all useState hooks to the top of the component (before any conditional returns)
   - Move the `onUpdateSettings` call from the render phase to a useEffect hook
   - Added a conditional check to return a loading state if settings is null or undefined

### Implementation

1. **Fixed LinearProgress in Tasks.jsx**
   - Added `variant="indeterminate"` to the LinearProgress component

2. **Refactored LlmProviderSettings.jsx**
   - Moved all useState hooks to the top of the component
   - Added a useEffect hook to initialize llmProviders if missing
   - Added a conditional check to return a loading state if settings is null or undefined

### Testing

The changes should fix both errors:

- The LinearProgress component now explicitly has a variant="indeterminate" prop
- The state update in LlmProviderSettings now happens in a useEffect hook instead of during render

### Issue Investigation: TypeError in AgentSettings Component

- Investigating a new error in the AgentSettings component:
  - `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` at line 571 in AgentSettings.jsx
- The error occurs when trying to edit an agent in the settings page
- Checked the code in `client/src/components/settings/AgentSettings.jsx` and found that the error occurs in the Autocomplete component

### Root Cause

The error occurs in the `handleEditAgent` function when setting the state for editing an agent. The function was not checking if the `tools` and `directives` properties exist on the agent object before trying to access them. If these properties are undefined, trying to access their `length` property would cause the error.

### Solution

Modified the `handleEditAgent` function to ensure that `tools` and `directives` are always arrays, even if they are undefined in the original agent data:

```javascript
// Edit an existing agent
const handleEditAgent = (agent) => {
  // Ensure tools is always an array
  setNewAgent({ 
    ...agent,
    tools: agent.tools || [],
    directives: agent.directives || []
  });
  setEditingAgent(agent);
  setAddDialogOpen(true);
};
```

### Testing

The change should fix the TypeError when editing an agent in the settings page.

### Additional Fixes

After testing, I found that there were still some places in the AgentSettings component where we were trying to access properties of potentially undefined objects. I added more optional chaining operators to fix these issues:

1. Added optional chaining for `settings?.llmProviders?.find()` in multiple places
2. Added optional chaining for `settings?.agents?.hierarchyLevels?.find()` 
3. Set a default empty object for the settings prop: `{ settings = {}, onUpdateSettings }`

These changes ensure that the component doesn't try to access properties of undefined objects, which would cause "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors.

### Further Fixes for ProjectManagerSettings

I also found similar issues in the ProjectManagerSettings component. I applied the same fixes:

1. Added a default empty object for the settings prop: `{ settings = {}, onUpdateSettings }`
2. Added optional chaining for `settings?.llmProviders?.find()` in multiple places
3. Added optional chaining for `settings?.agents?.items?.map()` in the handleSave function
4. Added optional chaining for `settings?.agents?.hierarchyLevels?.map()` in the hierarchy level select component

These changes ensure that the ProjectManagerSettings component also doesn't try to access properties of undefined objects, which would cause "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors.

### Additional Fixes for ToolSettings

I found similar issues in the ToolSettings component as well. I applied the same fix:

1. Added a default empty object for the settings prop: `{ settings = {}, onUpdateSettings }`

The ToolSettings component already had proper optional chaining for most of its property accesses, but adding the default empty object ensures that it doesn't try to access properties of undefined objects.

### Fixed LinearProgress Error in Tasks Component

I also fixed the LinearProgress error in the Tasks component:

1. Added `variant="indeterminate"` to the LinearProgress component in the Tasks.jsx file

This ensures that the LinearProgress component doesn't try to use the "determinate" or "buffer" variant without a corresponding value prop, which was causing the error:
```
MUI: You need to provide a value prop when using the determinate or buffer variant of LinearProgress.
```

### Issue Investigation: Project Manager Tab Stuck on Loading

- Investigating an issue where the Project Manager tab in the settings is stuck on loading
- Checked the code in `client/src/components/settings/ProjectManagerSettings.jsx` and found that it was trying to fetch tools from the API
- The API endpoint `/api/tools` was returning a 404 error, causing the component to get stuck in a loading state
- The component was not handling the case when the API call fails

### Root Cause

The issue is that the ProjectManagerSettings component was trying to fetch tools from the API endpoint `/api/tools`, but this endpoint was returning a 404 error. The component didn't have proper error handling or fallback mechanisms, so it would get stuck in a loading state when the API call failed.

### Solution

Modified the ProjectManagerSettings component to:

1. **Improve error handling for the tools API call**:
   - Added a fallback to use tools from settings if the API call fails
   - Added a fallback to an empty array if no tools are available in settings

2. **Added a timeout to prevent infinite loading**:
   - Added a useEffect hook with a timeout that initializes the projectManager state with default values if loading takes too long
   - This ensures that the component doesn't get stuck in a loading state even if the API calls fail

3. **Improved the loading state UI**:
   - Added a loading message to the loading state to provide better feedback to the user

### Testing

The changes should fix the issue with the Project Manager tab being stuck on loading:

- The component now properly handles the case when the API call fails
- The component will automatically initialize with default values if loading takes too long
- The loading state now includes a message to provide better feedback to the user

### Issue Investigation: Chat Widget Not Working

- Investigating an issue where the chat widget is not working after setting up the Project Manager in settings
- Checked the code in `client/src/components/ChatWidget.jsx` and found that it was looking for a Project Manager agent in `settings.agents.items`
- Checked the code in `server/src/api/index.js` and found that there was no socket handler for the 'send_message' event
- Checked the settings structure in `config/settings.json` and found that the Project Manager configuration is at the top level in `settings.projectManager` instead of in `settings.agents.items`

### Root Cause

There are two issues:

1. The server doesn't have a socket handler for the 'send_message' event, so when the client sends a message, the server doesn't respond.
2. The client is looking for the Project Manager agent in `settings.agents.items`, but the actual configuration is at the top level in `settings.projectManager`.

### Solution

1. **Added a socket handler for the 'send_message' event in the server**:
   - Added a handler in `server/src/api/index.js` that responds to 'send_message' events
   - The handler checks if the Project Manager is enabled in `settings.features.projectManagerAgent`
   - The handler gets the Project Manager configuration from `settings.projectManager`
   - The handler sends a response message back to the client

2. **Updated the ChatWidget component to handle the new settings structure**:
   - Modified the initialization code to check if Project Manager is enabled in `settings.features.projectManagerAgent`
   - Modified the initialization code to get the Project Manager configuration from `settings.projectManager`
   - Updated the getChatTitle function to handle the new settings structure

### Testing

The changes should fix the issue with the chat widget not working:

- The server now responds to 'send_message' events from the client
- The client now properly initializes the chat widget based on the new settings structure
- The chat widget now shows the correct title and welcome message

### Issue Investigation: Chat Widget Using Canned Messages

- Investigating an issue where the chat widget is using canned messages instead of real LLM responses
- Checked the code in `server/src/api/index.js` and found that the socket handler for the 'send_message' event was using hardcoded responses
- Checked the settings structure in `config/settings.json` and found that the Project Manager is configured to use LM Studio with the model "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-mlx"

### Root Cause

The socket handler for the 'send_message' event in `server/src/api/index.js` was using hardcoded responses instead of calling the LLM API to generate responses. This is not allowed in a production environment where we must use 100% real LLM responses.

### Solution

1. **Updated the socket handler for the 'send_message' event in the server**:
   - Added a function to generate responses using the configured LLM (LM Studio or Ollama)
   - The function creates a system prompt for the Project Manager and sends it to the LLM API
   - The function handles errors and returns a fallback message if the LLM API call fails
   - Added support for both LM Studio (OpenAI-compatible API) and Ollama APIs

2. **Added a "thinking" state to the chat widget**:
   - Added a "thinking" message that is shown while the LLM is generating a response
   - The "thinking" message is replaced with the actual response when it's ready
   - This provides better feedback to the user while waiting for the LLM response

3. **Fixed a potential issue with React state updates**:
   - Used the functional update form of setMessages to ensure we're working with the latest state
   - This prevents issues with stale state due to React's closure behavior

### Testing

The changes should fix the issue with the chat widget using canned messages:

- The server now calls the LLM API to generate responses based on the user's message
- The chat widget now shows a "thinking" state while waiting for the LLM response
- The chat widget now shows the real LLM-generated response when it's ready
